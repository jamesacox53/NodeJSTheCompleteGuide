I think I need to do some research on JSON Web Tokens. The lecturer said that there is dedicated storage in the browser for JWTs. 
I think he did it in his React app. I need to do some research on where JWTs are stored in the browser.

To send a JWT token in a request you need to send it in the headers as part of the Authorization header. The Authorization header needs to be 'Bearer ' + webToken.
For example:
fetch(URL, {
	headers: {
		Authorization: 'Bearer ' + webToken
	},
	...
});
