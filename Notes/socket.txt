Checkout the socket.io docs. The package you have to install on the client is: socket.io-client

import openSocket from 'socket.io-client';
...
const socket = openSocket('http://localhost:8080');
socket.on('posts', data => {
    if (data.action === 'create') {
        this.addPost(data.post);
    
    } else if (data.action === 'update') {
        this.updatePost(data.post);
    
    } else if (data.action === 'delete') {
        this.loadPosts();
    }
});

First fetch the posts then call the openSocket function with the web server address.
You do need to use http as websocket is built up on that. The socket.on() function
listens for the 'posts' event which is fired by the server. then data is an object
that we defined on the server, it's passed over. this.addPost is just an example 
of something we could do like adding the post.
