Checkout the socket.io docs. The package you have to install on the client is: socket.io-client

import openSocket from 'socket.io-client';
...
openSocket('http://localhost:8080');

First fetch the posts then call the openSocket function with the web server address.
You do need to use http as websocket is built up on that.
